# ScalabilityDemo
A demo of measuring the time of computation by multiplying 2 matrix of varying size. The graph plotted is size of the matrix against time in nanosecs to multiply them together. Completed to aid in a University Lecture.

To RUN:
Ensure you have Pip, Python3, and Java/JVM installed on your machine
Download all three files into the same directory. 
Run the master.py file in the command line
  (Windows: Open cmd in the file directory, then run "py master.py")
  
 The master file will then run the computation, produce a csv file of plotting points, and use that to create a graph which will auto pop up
 Note the increase (but not at a steady incline)
 Feel free to open the Matrix.java file to inspect how it works. Theres some code not needed, but all the "graph mode" code is relevent.
